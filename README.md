    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run Pipeline (Sequential):**

## ✅ Task 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing (Complete)

**Goal:** Collect $\mathbf{1,200+}$ clean reviews (400+ per bank).

### Status

* **Scraping Status:** **Functionally Complete.** Fixed `KeyError` and implemented country code (`et`). Successfully collected **600+ reviews for CBE**. Requires rerun to collect data for BOA and Dashen using corrected IDs.
* **App IDs:** Updated to point to current, active apps.
    * **BOA:** `com.boa.boaMobileBanking`
    * **Dashen:** `com.dashen.dashensuperapp`
* **Deliverable:** `data/raw/reviews_raw.csv` and `data/clean/reviews_clean.csv`.

## 🔬 Task 2: Sentiment and Thematic Analysis

**Goal:** Apply NLP to quantify user emotion and identify recurring pain points and feature requests.

### Key Activities

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Computed scores (positive/negative/neutral) using VADER.
* **Thematic Analysis:** Extract keywords (TF-IDF/spaCy) and cluster them into 3-5 high-level themes (e.g., 'Account Access', 'Transaction Performance').

---

## 💾 Task 3: Store Cleaned Data in PostgreSQL

**Goal:** Design and implement a relational database to store the processed review data persistently.

### Database Schema

* **Database:** `bank_reviews`
* **Tables:** `Banks` (Bank ID, Name) and `Reviews` (Review ID, **Foreign Key to Bank ID**, Text, Rating, Date, Sentiment Label, Theme).
* **Tooling:** Use `psycopg2` or `SQLAlchemy` for insertion via Python.

### Setup Database (Docker)

```bash
docker run --name pg-bank-reviews -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

---

### Create Tables Using `schema.sql`

```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d bank_reviews
\i path/to/db/schema.sql
```

> `schema.sql` contains `banks` and `reviews` tables—no manual creation needed.

---

### Query / Inspect Data

```sql
-- Preview first 10 reviews
SELECT * FROM reviews LIMIT 10;

-- Count reviews per bank
SELECT bank_id, COUNT(*) FROM reviews GROUP BY bank_id;
```

> Keeping `schema.sql` in GitHub allows easy recreation of the database structure.
